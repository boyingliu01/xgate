# GITHOOKS KNOWLEDGE BASE

**Generated:** 2026-05-02
**Commit:** 1f6bc7d
**Branch:** main

## OVERVIEW
Git quality gates: pre-commit (6 Gates) and pre-push (Delphi code walkthrough via `--mode code-walkthrough`) for enforcing automated standards. Zero-tolerance policy enforced by QUALITY-GATES-CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md.

## STRUCTURE
```

## WHERE TO LOOK
| Task | Location | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Language Adapters | adapters/ | TypeScript/Python/Go/Shell specific static analysis + lint + test |
| Pre-commit Gates | pre-commit:60-2000+ | Gate 1-6: Code Quality, Dup Code, Complexity, Principles, Tests, Architecture |
| Gate 6 Architecture + Boy Scout | pre-commit:1769+ | archlint + boy-scout.ts: differential warning enforcement |
| CCN Thresholds | pre-commit | CCN_THRESHOLD=5, CCN_ERROR_THRESHOLD=10 |
| Pre-push Review | pre-push | Delphi code walkthrough via `delphi-review --mode code-walkthrough` |
| Zero-Tolerance Policy | QUALITY-GATES-CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md | Prohibits --no-verify bypass |
| Tool Installation | TOOL-INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md | Setup instructions |

## CONVENTIONS
- **Zero-tolerance**: Hooks block if tools unavailable
- Must install required tools for language stack before committing
- Gate 6: Architecture quality + Boy Scout Rule (Clean Architecture boundary validation + differential warning enforcement)
- Gate 3: Cyclomatic complexity (CCN >5 warn, CCN >10 block)
- Gate 5: Boy Scout Rule (unified — auto-initializes baseline when missing)
- Pre-push hook checks for size limits (max 20 files, 500 LOC)
- Documentation-only projects skip code analysis but verify specs
- Boy Scout Rule: new files zero-tolerance; modified files cannot increase warnings; ≤5 warnings must clear to zero

## ANTI-PATTERNS (THIS PROJECT)
- Do NOT skip pre-commit checks (linting, type checks, tests)
- Do NOT bypass pre-push walkthrough for code changes
- Do NOT push large commits exceeding size limits
- Do NOT use `--no-verify` to bypass gate failures (per CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)

## UNIQUE STYLES
- **6-gate** pre-commit structure (Gate 1: Code Quality, Gate 2: Dup Code, Gate 3: CCN, Gate 4: Principles, Gate 5: Tests, Gate 6: Architecture + Boy Scout)
- Fail-fast approach (blocks if tools not available)
- Automated integration with OpenCode CLI
- Multi-language stack detection (9 language adapters)
- Size-limited change reviews (20 files, 500 LOC)
- Boy Scout Rule differential enforcement via TypeScript CLI (auto-baseline initialization)
- Quality Gates Code of Conduct (zero-tolerance for --no-verify bypass)

## COMMANDS
```bash
# Install hooks (project root)
bash githooks/install.sh [--force]

# Verify installation
bash githooks/verify.sh
```

## NOTES
- Pre-commit hook performs static analysis, testing, and architecture validation
- Pre-push hook triggers Delphi code walkthrough review
- Enforces both tool availability and code quality standards
- `--no-verify` strictly prohibited when tools report errors
